# Pragmateam code challenge client (React)

Please refer to the provided document for the code challenge requirements. 

- Time started : 5.32 P.M. SGT
- Time completed: 7.54 P.M. SGT

### Configuration

#Summary
### Highlights of improvements
- Add unit tests for temperature status span before start code refactorings 
- Extract temperature state as a component and verify test still pass 
- Refactor TemperatureState component tests 
- Extract static data to a separate class
- Handle exceptions 

### What would I improve next if I had more time
- I would further refactor table class by introduce new component 
- Add more unit test 
- Add suspense component while loading
- Change current API call, I feel the way it consume the api is not nice.
- I would create custom hook and consume in APP
- will do more n more refactorings,

### Explanations of decisions or the approach I took
This exercise is about technical depth, hence I believe they would not expect me change any API contract in application.
Since project does not have proper safety harness, before I start refactoring I makesure to add enough tests to application and verify all are running well.
